<h1>HotDocs ðŸŒ­</h1>

Flame-grilled API Documentations

## What is HotDocs?
HotDocs is a simple template for API Documentations. You just have to edit the `data.json` file and you are good to go!

## How can I use it for my Project? (aka. Installation)
1. Download or clone this repo.
2. Edit the `data.json` file and insert your API details (endpoints, etc.)
3. For each of your endpoints, add a file with an example response in the folder `example-responses`
4. You're done! Open the `index.html` file in your Browser and enjoy your beautiful-looking API Documentation!

## Demo
You can have a look at an Example API Documentation [here](https://anthemaker.github.io/HotDocs/).

## Frequently Asked Questions
### Why does this look so good?
Because of [Bulma](https://bulma.io)! Bulma is a free, 100% mobile responsive CSS Framework!

### Why did you chose this name?
I guess I was hungry. Sorry about that.

### This is cool
That's not a question. But thank you.

### But generating all the content with JavaScript is bad for SEO!
I know. Maybe I come up with a better soulution to do this in the future. Stay tuned!

### What techniques are used under the hood?
Just jQuery and Bulma. That's it.

### Why did you made this?
I wanted to have a simple way to create good looking API Documentations for my projects without hard-coding everything.

### Can I use this for my API Documentations?
Of course you can!

### Do I have to give credits for using HotDocs?
No you don't have to. I mean it would look wired if someone would read "powered by hotdocs ðŸŒ­" somewhere on your site, wouldn't it?
